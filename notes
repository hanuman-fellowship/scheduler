TODO:

	- People should not have a schedule_id and be copied like the rest.
		- There should be a field called 'current' which is boolean
		- This way when people come and go, they can just be reintroduced into the current schedule
		- Would be done by a check, in sFind in the Person model, if they are 'current'
		- Removing a person does not delete them, it just turns their 'current' status off
		  (and unassigns them from all of their shifts).
		- You can 'Get Perosn From the Past..." wich will turn their 'current' on.

	- Continue making validation
