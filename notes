TODO:

	- Go to old scheduler and add a field for last name and go through and put the correct
	  names. Jairam? Maybe write an interface for that where it prompts for each person
	  and each date range.

	- Requests
		FIX: the way new shifts/assignments are saved (by subtracting 1 from the lowest id)
		is flawed. What if there are no ids? Also, when creating a new request, what if the
		ids, that are simply made negative, conflict with an id that is already there
		(which would be there because someone editing an existing request created it)?
		
		Should request forms be an entire schedule like operations has? maybe the manager would
		only be able to edit the areas for which they had access?? there would be a field in the
		schedule table called request (true or false). that way, they could have undo, etc.

		or... just keep it the same with the negative ids, but create every one on the fly, so
		when importing all of the shifts and assignments it would go through each one and create
		new ids and then make the foreign keys correctly too...

	- CRUD resident categories

	- edit times

	- publish multiple schedules (for retreats, etc.)
		- auto publish times?


	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	BUGS:
		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?
		- Merge:
			- Try this: unassign someone and then reassign the same person (instead of undoing)
			then assign that same person to that shift in another schedule.
			if you try to merge from the first schedule, the first assign will cancel out and the 
			person will not be assigned, even though they are in the other schedule

	- Floating Shift
		- Make sure description is set correctly 

	- Users
	 	edit

	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
	
	- Make colors (css) of resident caegories configurable.
		- figure out how to automatically lighten links? or maybe find another way to highlight on hover.
		- perhaps no color behind the person schedule, but just their name is colored.
