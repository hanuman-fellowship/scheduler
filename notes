TODO:

	- CRUD resident categories

	- edit times

	- publish multiple schedules (for retreats, etc.)
		- auto publish times?


	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	BUGS:
		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?
		- Merge:
			- Try this: unassign someone and then reassign the same person (instead of undoing)
			then assign that same person to that shift in another schedule.
			if you try to merge from the first schedule, the first assign will cancel out and the 
			person will not be assigned, even though they are in the other schedule

	- Houses!!

	- Floating Shift
		- Make sure description is set correctly 

	- Users
		- Create, modify, delete...

	- Person
		- Restore
			- The view should be a search box that populates the list using ajax.
	
	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
	
	- Merge Branch?

	- Make colors (css) of resident caegories configurable.
		- figure out how to automatically lighten links? or maybe find another way to highlight on hover.
		- perhaps no color behind the person schedule, but just their name is colored.
