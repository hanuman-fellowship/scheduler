TODO:

	Headaches:

		- Slowness with lots of old published schedules
		- Maybe transform old published schedules into html? how?

	- add publish button to schedule message

	- submit request

	- Description for editing a person

	- Go to old scheduler and add a field for last name and go through and put the correct
	  names. Jairam? Maybe write an interface for that where it prompts for each person
	  and each date range.

	- edit times

	- publish multiple schedules (for retreats, etc.)
		- auto publish times?


	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	BUGS:
		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?

	- Floating Shift
		- Description is a little screwy

	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
