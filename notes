TODO:
	
	- blast! some things (clear areas, retire people) are slooooow! recording all of those
	  changes is one problem... maybe there's a way to keep a running tally of all
	  intended saves/deletes for each model and then do them all at once?
	  The whole thing with nudge might be a big problem... redesign it?

	- kinda wierd to define the effective only when publishing... would be good
	  to be able to make a working copy and then change the effective... somehow...

	- order of people on request

	- big board

	- hours by area etc...

	- notes on person and area

	- floating shift on area request

	- personnel

	- templates

	- delete all shifts, delete all areas, delete all people, etc...

	- new schedule (instead of working copy)

	- Description for editing a person

	- edit times

	- when pubishing a schedule, ask for start and end dates. start date defaults to "now"
	  if it falls during another published schedule, user is asked for a name and it is offered
	  as an alternate schedule (like for retreats). If start date is later, the schedule will 
	  automatically be available starting at that time... etc...
	
	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	BUGS:
		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?

	- Floating Shift
		- Description is a little screwy

	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
