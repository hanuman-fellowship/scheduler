TODO:

	- Constant Shift

	- write a function to convert legacy data

	- Make dialog styles consistent

	BUGS:

		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?

	- Flash messages next to menu
		- description of actions, etc...

	- Houses!!

	- Floating Shift
		- edit, delete
		- Make sure description is set correctly for update and delete

	- Users
		- Create, modify, delete...

	- Person
		- Restore
			- The view should be a search box that populates the list using ajax.

	- Schedules
		- Save as... instead of "new"
		- Open...
			- Schedules will not have owners, but when you open one, the user id goes in the schedule so that no one else can edit. They can read only. When you open another schedule, your user id is taken off of it.
		- Publish

	- Menu
		- Can the submenu width be automatic?
	
	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
			- maybe two columns, one for redos and one for undos
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
	
	- Merge Branch?

	- Make colors (css) of resident caegories configurable.
		- figure out how to automatically lighten links? or maybe find another way to highlight on hover.
		- perhaps no color behind the person schedule, but just their name is colored.
