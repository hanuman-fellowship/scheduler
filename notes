TODO:

	- add groups (for schedules) and give schedules a group_id. This group will have the
	  name of the schedule and the start and end times. all schedules published under this group
	  are just versions of each other, so when looking back to old schedules, only the groups
	  are shown.

	- big board

	- hours by area etc...

	- notes on person and area

	- floating shift on area request

	- personnel

	- templates

	- delete all shifts, delete all areas, delete all people, etc...

	- new schedule (instead of working copy)

	- Description for editing a person

	- edit times

	- when pubishing a schedule, ask for start and end dates. start date defaults to "now"
	  if it falls during another published schedule, user is asked for a name and it is offered
	  as an alternate schedule (like for retreats). If start date is later, the schedule will 
	  automatically be available starting at that time... etc...
	
	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	BUGS:
		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?

	- Floating Shift
		- Description is a little screwy

	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
