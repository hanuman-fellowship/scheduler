TODO:

	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- when undoing or redoing, need to check if PeopleSchedules is changed, and delete the session caches

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	- write a function to convert legacy data

	- Make dialog styles consistent

	BUGS:

		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?

	- Flash messages next to menu
		- description of actions, etc...

	- Houses!!

	- Floating Shift
		- Make sure description is set correctly 

	- Users
		- Create, modify, delete...

	- Person
		- Restore
			- The view should be a search box that populates the list using ajax.

	- Menu
		- Can the submenu width be automatic?
	
	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
			- maybe two columns, one for redos and one for undos
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
	
	- Merge Branch?

	- Make colors (css) of resident caegories configurable.
		- figure out how to automatically lighten links? or maybe find another way to highlight on hover.
		- perhaps no color behind the person schedule, but just their name is colored.
