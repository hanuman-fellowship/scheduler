	- merge... display conflicts nicely and find a way to deal with them. put conflicts into
	  session and then let the user play with the schedule? maybe the conflicts on the schedule
	  could show up red, and mousing over them would show the conflict...

	- check to see if more than one published schedule is happening now
		- default to the one that is ending soonest, and offer the others as options

	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

		- Retire everone and then assign a shift by typing in the "other"
			Undefined index:   [APP/config/bootstrap.php, line 89]
