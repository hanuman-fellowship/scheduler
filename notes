TODO:
	
	- kinda wierd to define the effective only when publishing... would be good
	  to be able to make a working copy and then change the effective... somehow...

	- order of people on request

	- big board

	- hours by area etc...

	- notes on person and area

	- floating shift on area request

	- personnel

	- templates

	- Description for editing a person

	- edit times

	- why the error in ie? should i use more prototype for the dialog?

	- merge... display conflicts nicely and find a way to deal with them. put conflicts into
	  session and then let the user play with the schedule? maybe the conflicts on the schedule
	  could show up red, and mousing over them would show the conflict...

	- check to see if more than one published schedule is happening now
		- default to the one that is ending soonest, and offer the others as options

	- show schedules as a tree going down from pubished based on which they were copied from

	- order working copies by date or by name in the select schedule dialog
	
	- schedule helper
		- combine displayAreaFloating and DisplayPersonFloating

	BUGS:
		- Why does it save two id entries in the change_fields when doing assignments::swap?
		- Retire everone and then assign a shift by typing in the "other"
			Undefined index:   [APP/config/bootstrap.php, line 89]
		- Add Person
			Undefined index:  Person [APP/models/people_schedules.php, line 34]

	- Floating Shift
		- Description is a little screwy

	- Changes
		- views/changes/history needs work
		- jump is slow. could it do all of the calculations first, and then update the database all at once?
